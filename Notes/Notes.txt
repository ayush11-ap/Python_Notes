## Episode 1:
    - Python Inner Working 

    - Python code is converted into [Byte Code](which is hidden in some cases it's visible like while import and all) & then it is fetched in the [Python Virtual Machine] inside this program/scripts are executed.
        - 1. first it's compile[slang] to Byte Code which is [low level] & [Platform Independent]
        - 2. Byte Code runs faster. .pyc is a compiled python [aka frozen Binaries]
        - 3. Python also uses diff algorithms internally for doing changes in [313(vesion of python)].pyc

    - PVM - Python Virtual Machine
        - Bcoz of PVM python is known as the interpreted language.
        - Byte Code is NOT Machine Code
            - Machine Code can give direct instruction to the Apple/intel chip i.e hardware
        - Byte Code is python specific interpretation
        - cpython it's a standard implementation
            - various types of python : jython, Iron Python, Stackless, PyPy, etc.

## Episode 2:
    ~ Errors:
        - NameError: name 'variableName' is not defined
        
    - with python `os` is bydefault library
        - os.getcwd()       -> gives current working directory

    - To reload Shell : from importlib import reload
        - reload(`fileName`)
